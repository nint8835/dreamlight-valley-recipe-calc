# Dreamlight Valley Recipe Calculator

This project is an app to calculate the costs, ingredient quantities, and profit amounts for recipes in Disney Dreamlight Valley.

Currently, it only supports one specific use case, which is cooking souffl√©s with ingredients bought from Remy and coal you mined yourself as this is my current method of grinding for money (and the inspiration behind this project, as I wanted to know for certain how many of each ingredient to buy to use up all the money I had), but the plan is to expand this to support more ingredients, recipes, and stores / stalls in the future.
